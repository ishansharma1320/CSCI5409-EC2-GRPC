# AWS EC2 Operations using gRPC - My Experience

In this repository, I've showcased my understanding of AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Simple Storage Service (S3), and the gRPC framework. The project demonstrates how to build a gRPC server deployed on an EC2 instance, incorporating various AWS operations and API development concepts. Let's dive into what this project is about and the key insights I gained from completing it.

## Introduction

The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate my proficiency in utilizing AWS services (EC2 and S3), implementing a gRPC server, and building APIs. By combining these aspects, I aimed to create a platform for performing EC2 operations using the gRPC framework.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I achieved several important learning outcomes:

- **EC2 Operations:** I gained an in-depth understanding of launching and managing AWS EC2 instances. This involved configuring instances to support web applications and connecting to them effectively.

- **S3 Interaction:** I learned about the AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) and how to create buckets. I also explored using AWS libraries, such as boto3, to programmatically interact with S3.

- **gRPC Implementation:** By building a gRPC server and client, I gained experience in working with the gRPC framework. I successfully integrated the Protocol Buffers serialization format into gRPC communication.

- **API Development:** Developing the gRPC server allowed me to enhance my API development skills. I learned how to define service methods, messages, and endpoints using Protocol Buffers.

## Requirements

To complete the project, I followed these steps:

1. **Proto File Definition:** I created a `.proto` file that outlined the structure of the gRPC service, encompassing both the server and client specifications.

2. **Code Compilation:** I compiled the `.proto` file using the appropriate language-specific commands. This compilation generated the necessary code to establish communication between the server and client.

3. **Server Implementation:** I developed a server file that implemented the gRPC service, exposing the defined API endpoints to clients.

4. **Client Implementation:** I crafted a client file that utilized the generated code to interact with the server's gRPC API.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally or deploy it on AWS, I followed these steps:

1. **AWS Setup:** I configured my AWS credentials and set up my environment for interaction with AWS services.

2. **Repository Setup:** I cloned this repository to my local machine.

3. **Dependency Installation:** I installed any necessary dependencies based on my chosen programming language.

4. **Proto File Compilation:** I compiled the `.proto` file using the appropriate commands to generate the required gRPC code.

5. **Server Deployment:** I deployed the gRPC server on an EC2 instance.

6. **Client Execution:** I executed the client code to interact with the deployed gRPC server, simulating AWS EC2 and S3 operations.

## Usage

The usage of this project involved the following steps:

1. **Server Launch:** I started the gRPC server on an EC2 instance.

2. **Client Interaction:** I ran the client code to initiate interactions with the gRPC server.

3. **Exploration:** Through the client-server communication, I explored and observed the simulation of AWS EC2 and S3 operations.

## Key Takeaways

Completing this project was a significant learning experience for me. I expanded my knowledge and skills in various areas:

- **AWS Proficiency:** I gained confidence in working with AWS services like EC2 and S3, from launching instances to managing storage.

- **gRPC Mastery:** By implementing the gRPC server and client, I deepened my understanding of the gRPC framework and its integration with Protocol Buffers.

- **API Development Expertise:** Building the gRPC service improved my ability to design and implement APIs, taking advantage of structured data serialization.
